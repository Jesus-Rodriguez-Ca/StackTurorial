  <h1>Monitoring Supplement</h1>
  
  
  <h3>Shell Script</h3>
  
  <p>The first task in making a monitoring script is to create a directory for executable files. By convention, scripts and user-compiled binaries go in the /bin subdirectory of the user's home directory:</p>
  
  <pre>mkdir $HOME/bin/</pre>
  
  <p>Now, change directory to $HOME/bin/:</p>
  
  <pre>cd $HOME/bin/</pre>
  
  <p>Next, create a file called "stackmon.sh":</p>
  
  <pre>touch stackmon.sh</pre>
  
  <p>Then, make it executable:</p>
  
  <pre>chmod +x stackmon.sh</pre>
  
  <p>Finally, open stackmon.sh in ed(1), the standard Unix&trade; editor:
 
  <pre>ed stackmon.sh</pre>

  <p>To enter text, type a single lowercase "a", then press Enter, entering append mode, and type the following:</p>
  
  <pre>
	#!/bin/sh
	if ! [ -d $HOME/log ]; then
		mkdir $HOME/log
	fi

	date >> $HOME/log/stackmon.log
    if ps ax | grep node | grep -v grep | awk '{print $5}' > /dev/null
	then
		echo "The Node.js app is running." >> $HOME/log/stackmon.log
		echo "The Node.js app is running." | wall -n
		logger -p 6 The Node.js app is running.
	else
		
		echo "The Node.js app is NOT running." >> $HOME/log/stackmon.log
		echo "The Node.js app is NOT running." | wall -n
		logger -p 0 The Node.js app is NOT running.
	fi

  </pre>
  
  <p>To stop entering text, press Enter a couple of times to get a blank line, type a single "." on the blank line, then press Enter. Type a lowercase "w" followed by the Enter key to save, then a lowercase "q", followed by Enter, to quit.</p>
  
  
  <h3>Cron</h3>
  
  <p>To make the monitoring script run automatically via cron, we need to add a crontab entry:</p>
  <pre>crontab -e</pre>
  <p>Since you now know how to use ed(1), choose option 4, and press Enter.</p>
  <p>Go to the last line in the file by typing "$", followed by the Enter key.</p>
  <p>As before, enter append mode with a lowercase "a", followed by the Enter key. This time, make sure you insert a blank line BEFORE pasting in the text, since append will start at the end of the last line of existing text.</p>
  <p>Add the following line to your crontab to run the monitoring script every five minutes:</p>
  <pre>0/5 * * * * $HOME/bin/stackmon.sh</pre>
  <p>Again, press Enter at least twice, followed by a single "." on a blank line to leave append mode. Use a single "w", then Enter, to write the file to disk, then a single "q", follwed by Enter, to quit.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, some current Linux distributions seem to have a broken implementation of cron that won't accept fractional time increments, probably due to Lennart Poettering and the systemd team. On these systems, we'll have to settle for running our monitoring script once per hour:</p>

  <pre>0 * * * * $HOME/bin/stackmon.sh</pre>
